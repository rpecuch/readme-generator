  ## Description

The purpose of this project was to apply Node.js concepts to create a simple but practical application. This application generates a professional README file based on user input, which will allow developers to spend more time on coding. While building this project, I became comfortable using Node.js and learned about the implementation of arrow functions, variable scoping, template literals, and modularization.
